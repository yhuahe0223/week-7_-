# Append the value of current to the end of the list seconds Please use the list.append() method to do that.


seconds = [1.23, 1.45, 1.02]
current = 1.11

# Remove item 1.45 from seconds.
seconds = [1.23, 1.45, 1.02, 1.11]


# Remove items 1.45, 1.02, and 1.11 from seconds.
seconds = [1.23, 1.45, 1.02, 1.11]

# Comparison Operators Practice  1:
# Create two variables (num1 and num2) with the following values: 36 and 17. Check if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool



# Comparison Operators Practice  2:
# Create two variables (num1 and num2):
# Inside num1, store the result of the square root of 25
# Inside num2, store the number 5.
# Check if num1 is equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.


# Comparison Operators Practice #3:
# Create two variables (num1 and num2):

# Inside num1, store the result of 64 x 3

# Inside num2, store the result of 24 x 8

# Check if num1 is different from num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.
