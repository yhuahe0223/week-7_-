# List Comprehensions Practice #1
# To do the coding exercise below, you can choose different paths. While the correct path in programming is the one that returns the correct result, I encourage you to try applying list comprehension concepts to begin to assimilate them for the future. They can be very useful in your professional practice!

# Create a square_values list consisting of the numbers in the values list, squared.

# values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.5]

# Create an even_values list consisting of the numbers in the values list that (you guessed it!) are even.

# values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.5]

# For the following list of temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit, express these same values in a new list of temperature values in degrees Celsius. The conversion between type of units is as follows:

# °C = (°F - 32) * (5/9)

# or expressed in another way:

# (degrees_fahrenheit-32)*(5/9)

# The list of temperatures is as follows:

# temperature_fahrenheit = [32, 212, 275]

# Store this new list in a variable called degrees_celsius
